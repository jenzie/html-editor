		<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><img src="../../_themes/capsules/capsepa.gif" height="10" width="600"></font></p>
		<font face="Arial, Helvetica">For
this project you will develop a simple editor for HTML files.&nbsp; The
project will start in Unit 2 and be continued in Unit 3. Teams will
stay the same through both units of work. The emphasis for the project
is the application of patterns in appropriate places and justification
of those choices.&nbsp; A working program must be created.&nbsp; Since
the emphasis of the course is design, spiffy implementations sitting on
top of a weak design will not be viewed favorably.&nbsp; This is also
not a pattern frenzy, in that, there almost definitely will be areas
where it is not appropriate to apply a pattern to the design. </font>
		<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Each
release will have a set of requirements defined.&nbsp; The release 2
requirements may necessitate refactoring of your release 1 code
base.&nbsp; As new patterns are discussed in class incorporation of
them should also be considered.</font></p>
		<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#000099">Release 1 Requirements</font></font></h2>
		<div align="left">
			<p>The release 1 functional requirements are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The
editor shall provide a point-and-click method to specify an HTML file
to edit and a method to browse directories.&nbsp; The name of the HTML
file can also be specified as a command line argument.</font>
				</li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The
editor should be able to have multiple files open for editing.&nbsp; If
multiple files are open, the user can select which file is being viewed.</font>
				</li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The
editor shall support the insertion of standard HTML constructs.&nbsp;
At a minimum, this support should allow the user to select an HTML
construct.&nbsp; The editor shall then insert the standard set of
matching tags for that construct into the current HTML buffer at the
current location for editing.&nbsp; At least the following constructs
should be supported: headers, font emphasis (bold, italics), list
(numbered, bulleted, dictionary), tables.&nbsp; The editor may provide
additional support such as prompting for fields in the construct.&nbsp;
It shall allow for specifying the size of a table or list and cause
that number of internal item tags to be inserted in the file.</font>
							</li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The editor shall support cut-and-paste editing within a buffer and between buffers.</font>
							</li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The
editor shall allow the user to select editor options via menu choices.
The editor may optionally provide selection via short-cut or
accelerator keys.</font>
							</li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The
editor shall provide a method to save changes to the HTML file with the
current file name, a modified file name, or newly specified name if it
is the first editing session on this file.</font>
				</li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The
editor shall provide a check that the buffer is well-formed HTML. The
editor shall perform a well-formed check when loading a file and alert
the user that the loaded file is not well-formed. The editor may
operate with reduced functionality until the user corrects the buffer
and a well-formed check passes. The editor shall perform a well-formed
check when saving a buffer and alert the user that the buffer being
saved is not well-formed. The editor shall allow the user to abort the
save or continue.</font>
				</li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The
editor shall provide a way to terminate operation.&nbsp; It shall warn
the user if any buffers have unsaved changes and allow the user to
abort program termination.</font>
				</li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The
editor shall support auto-wrap of text at the end of a line.&nbsp; When
the cursor reaches the right margin a new line will be opened
below.&nbsp; The word currently being typed is moved to this new line
and entry continues.&nbsp; The word-wrap feature can be turned on and
off.</font>
				</li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The editor
shall support auto-indent of HTML constructs.&nbsp; Auto-indent will
show the structure of the HTML constructs such as lists and
tables.&nbsp; If the cursor is auto-wrapped while information is being
entered the cursor will auto-indent the wrapped-text.&nbsp; If the
enter key is typed the cursor will auto-indent on the next line.&nbsp;
Indentation on a new line will be at the same level as the previous
line unless a new structure has been entered such as a list item.&nbsp;
Once a line is indented the user can change the indentation spacing by
editing the text.&nbsp; This change will be the spacing used for future
indentation of the current level.&nbsp; The auto-indentation feature
can be turned on and off.&nbsp; The user can specify the number of
characters for indentation.</font>
				</li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The
editor shall have a command for indenting the current line, the
selected text or the entire buffer.&nbsp; This will re-indent the
selected item to the current indentation specification.</font>
			</li></ul>
			<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The project non-functional requirements are:</font></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				<div align="left">
						<font face="Arial, Helvetica">The editor shall be written in Java.</font>
				<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The editor shall be tested for correct functionality on the systems in the SE labs.</font>
				</li><li>The editor may use code from the standard Java SDK.  The use of any other material must have prior instructor approval.
					</li><li>The working editor shall be delivered as an executable jar file.<br></li></div><br><div align="center">
